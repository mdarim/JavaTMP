To automate the deployment and execution of a Spring Boot application within a Docker
container on a remote server using Gradle, you can utilize
the [Gradle Docker Plugin](https://bmuschko.github.io/gradle-docker-plugin/). This plugin
facilitates the management of Docker images and containers directly from your Gradle build
script.

**1. Apply the Gradle Docker Plugin:**

First, include the plugin in your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
plugins {
    id 'com.bmuschko.docker-remote-api' version '6.7.0'
}
```

This plugin allows interaction with Docker's remote API, enabling tasks such as building
images and managing containers.

**2. Configure Docker Connection:**

Set up the plugin to connect to your remote Docker host by specifying the Docker daemon's
URL and, if necessary, authentication details:

```groovy
docker {
    url = 'tcp://remote-docker-host:2375' // Replace with your Docker host's address
    // If TLS is required:
    certPath = file('/path/to/certificates')
}
```

Ensure that your remote Docker daemon is configured to accept remote connections and that
any necessary certificates are correctly set up.

**3. Define Tasks to Build and Deploy the Docker Image:**

Create Gradle tasks to build your Spring Boot application's Docker image and deploy it to
the remote server:

```groovy
import com.bmuschko.gradle.docker.tasks.image.DockerBuildImage
import com.bmuschko.gradle.docker.tasks.container.DockerCreateContainer
import com.bmuschko.gradle.docker.tasks.container.DockerStartContainer

task buildDockerImage(type: DockerBuildImage) {
    inputDir = file('.')
    tags = ['your-application:latest']
}

task createDockerContainer(type: DockerCreateContainer) {
    dependsOn buildDockerImage
    targetImageId buildDockerImage.getImageId()
    portBindings = ['8080:8080'] // Map container port to host port
}

task startDockerContainer(type: DockerStartContainer) {
    dependsOn createDockerContainer
    targetContainerId createDockerContainer.getContainerId()
}
```

These tasks will build the Docker image, create a container from that image, and start the
container on your remote Docker host.

**4. Execute the Deployment:**

Run the following command to execute the defined tasks:

```bash
./gradlew startDockerContainer
```

This command will build the Docker image, create the container, and start it on the
specified remote Docker host.

**Additional Considerations:**

- **Remote Docker Host Configuration:** Ensure that your remote Docker daemon is properly
  configured to accept remote API requests and that any necessary firewall rules are in
  place to allow communication.

- **Security:** When exposing the Docker daemon remotely, it's crucial to secure the
  connection using TLS and to manage certificates appropriately to prevent unauthorized
  access.

By integrating these configurations into your Gradle build script, you can automate the
process of building, deploying, and running your Spring Boot application within a Docker
container on a remote server.
