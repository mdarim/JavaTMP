Cloud-native applications are designed to leverage cloud computing models, enabling organizations to build and run scalable, resilient, and manageable applications in dynamic environments. Key properties of cloud-native applications include:

1. **Microservices Architecture**: Applications are decomposed into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific functionality. This modularity allows for easier development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.

2. **Containerization**: Each microservice is packaged into lightweight containers, encapsulating the application code and its dependencies. Containers provide consistency across different environments and facilitate efficient resource utilization.

3. **API-Centric Communication**: Microservices interact through well-defined APIs, often using protocols like REST or gRPC. This approach ensures loose coupling and interoperability between services.

4. **Scalability and Elasticity**: Cloud-native applications can dynamically scale in response to varying workloads, efficiently utilizing cloud resources to maintain performance and cost-effectiveness.

5. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**: The architecture is designed to handle failures gracefully, with mechanisms like redundancy and automated recovery ensuring high availability and reliability.

6. **DevOps and Continuous Delivery**: Emphasis on agile development practices, including continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), enables rapid and reliable deployment of new features and updates.

7. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Infrastructure configurations are managed through code, allowing for version control, automation, and reproducibility of environments.

8. **Immutable Infrastructure**: Once deployed, components are not modified. Updates involve deploying new versions, ensuring consistency and simplifying rollback procedures.

9. **Automated Management**: Utilization of orchestration tools and platforms automates deployment, scaling, and management tasks, reducing manual intervention and operational complexity.

10. **Polyglot Programming**: Different services can be developed using the most suitable programming languages and frameworks, promoting flexibility and the use of best-of-breed technologies.

By incorporating these properties, cloud-native applications achieve greater agility, scalability, and resilience, aligning with modern business needs and technological advancements.
