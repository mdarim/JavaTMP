**Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** is a software development approach introduced by Eric Evans in his book *"Domain-Driven Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software"*. It focuses on building applications that reflect the complexity of the business domain and emphasizes collaboration between technical and domain experts.

### **Core Concepts of DDD**

#### **1. Ubiquitous Language**
- Create a shared language between developers and domain experts.
- Use the same terms in code, documentation, and discussions to reduce misunderstandings.
- Example: Use terms like "Order," "Customer," or "Invoice" consistently in both business discussions and code.

#### **2. Strategic Design**
Focuses on high-level architecture and relationships between different parts of the system.

##### **Bounded Context**
- Defines the boundary within which a domain model applies.
- Each bounded context has its own model, ensuring clarity and separation of concerns.
- Example: A "Sales" context and an "Inventory" context might both use the term "Product," but with different meanings.

##### **Context Mapping**
- Visualize and define relationships between different bounded contexts.
- Types of relationships:
    - **Shared Kernel**: Shared parts of the domain model.
    - **Customer-Supplier**: One context depends on another.
    - **Anti-Corruption Layer**: A layer to translate and adapt between contexts.

#### **3. Tactical Design**
Deals with the implementation details within a bounded context.

##### **Entities**
- Objects with a distinct identity that persists over time.
- Example: A "User" identified by a unique ID.

##### **Value Objects**
- Immutable objects that are defined by their attributes, not identity.
- Example: A "Money" object with `amount` and `currency`.

##### **Aggregates**
- A cluster of domain objects treated as a single unit.
- Controlled by a root entity (Aggregate Root) that enforces business rules.
- Example: An "Order" aggregate with an "Order" root entity and associated "OrderItems."

##### **Repositories**
- Encapsulate data access and retrieval logic for aggregates.
- Example: A `UserRepository` that provides methods like `findById` or `save`.

##### **Domain Services**
- Represent business logic that doesnâ€™t naturally belong to a specific entity or value object.
- Example: A "PaymentProcessor" service for handling payments.

##### **Factories**
- Create complex objects or aggregates, encapsulating the creation logic.
- Example: A `UserFactory` for creating new `User` instances.

##### **Events**
- Represent significant occurrences in the domain.
- Example: An "OrderPlaced" event triggered when a customer places an order.

### **Key Benefits of DDD**
1. **Aligns Software with Business Goals**:
    - Ensures the software reflects the business processes and rules accurately.
2. **Improves Collaboration**:
    - Encourages close interaction between technical teams and domain experts.
3. **Handles Complexity**:
    - Breaks the domain into manageable parts through bounded contexts and aggregates.
4. **Promotes Maintainability**:
    - Focus on separation of concerns makes the codebase easier to understand and modify.

### **When to Use DDD**
- **Complex Domains**: When business logic is intricate and evolving.
- **Collaborative Teams**: When domain experts and developers work closely.
- **Large-Scale Systems**: When modularity and scalability are crucial.

### **When Not to Use DDD**
- **Simple Applications**: For CRUD-based or simple applications, DDD might be overkill.
- **Tight Deadlines**: DDD's upfront design requires time and collaboration.

### **Implementing DDD with Spring Boot**
Spring Boot provides tools and frameworks that align well with DDD principles:
- **Entities and Repositories**: Use JPA to model entities and repositories.
- **Services**: Define domain and application services using `@Service`.
- **Event Handling**: Use Spring Events to handle domain events.
- **Validation**: Use annotations like `@Valid` to enforce domain rules.
- **Bounded Contexts**: Organize code into distinct modules or packages for each context.

### **Example: Online Shopping Domain**

#### **Bounded Contexts**:
1. **Catalog Context**:
    - Models Products and Categories.
2. **Order Context**:
    - Manages Orders and Payments.

#### **Tactical Design for Order Context**:
- **Entity**: `Order` with attributes like `id`, `customerId`, and `status`.
- **Value Object**: `Address` for shipping.
- **Aggregate Root**: `Order` manages `OrderItems`.
- **Repository**: `OrderRepository` handles persistence.
- **Domain Event**: `OrderPlacedEvent` triggers when an order is placed.

#### **Order Entity Example**:
```java
@Entity
public class Order {
    @Id
    private Long id;
    private Long customerId;
    private OrderStatus status;

    @OneToMany(cascade = CascadeType.ALL, mappedBy = "order")
    private List<OrderItem> items = new ArrayList<>();

    public void addItem(OrderItem item) {
        items.add(item);
        item.setOrder(this);
    }
}
```

**Domain-Driven Design** is a powerful approach for building robust and maintainable software in complex domains. It ensures that the software evolves with the business and remains aligned with its needs over time.
