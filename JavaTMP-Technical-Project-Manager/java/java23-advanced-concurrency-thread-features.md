### ðŸ§µ **Java 23: Advanced Concurrency and Threading Features**

Java 23 continues to build on its strong concurrency framework with **advanced threading features** introduced in previous versions like **virtual threads (Project Loom)** and **structured concurrency**. These new features aim to make **highly concurrent applications simpler, more efficient, and scalable** by reducing the complexities of traditional thread management.

Here are some of the **advanced concurrency features** available in Java 23:

---

## ðŸ”§ **1. Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**

Introduced in **Java 21**, **virtual threads** allow developers to create **lightweight threads** that scale better than traditional OS-managed threads. They are now the default recommendation for handling **concurrent I/O-bound tasks**.

### âœ… **Key Benefits:**

- **Handles millions of threads efficiently.**
- **Eliminates the need for thread pools.**
- Simplifies **blocking I/O** operations.
- Reduces **context-switching overhead**.

### ðŸ›  **Example: Using Virtual Threads in Java 23**

```java
public class VirtualThreadExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread virtualThread = Thread.ofVirtual().start(() -> {
            System.out.println("Hello from a virtual thread!");
        });

        // Wait for the virtual thread to finish
        try {
            virtualThread.join();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **2. Structured Concurrency (Preview in Java 23)**

**Structured Concurrency** helps manage multiple concurrent tasks within a defined scope, ensuring that tasks are started and completed in a predictable way. It simplifies **error handling** and ensures **clean termination** of concurrent tasks.

### âœ… **Key Benefits:**

- Reduces the risk of **resource leaks**.
- Ensures **clean cancellation** of tasks.
- Simplifies **error propagation** across concurrent tasks.

### ðŸ›  **Example: Using Structured Concurrency**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class StructuredConcurrencyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
            Future<String> task1 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService1());
            Future<String> task2 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService2());

            scope.join();              // Waits for all tasks to complete
            scope.throwIfFailed();     // Propagates any exceptions

            System.out.println("Results: " + task1.resultNow() + ", " + task2.resultNow());
        }
    }

    static String fetchDataFromService1() {
        return "Data from Service 1";
    }

    static String fetchDataFromService2() {
        return "Data from Service 2";
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **3. Thread-Per-Task Executors with Virtual Threads**

Java 23 makes it easier to use **virtual threads** by introducing **new executors** that create a **new virtual thread for each task**.

### âœ… **Key Benefits:**

- Eliminates the need for complex **thread pool management**.
- Ensures that each task runs in **isolation**.
- Automatically handles **blocking I/O operations**.

### ðŸ›  **Example: Using Virtual Thread Executor**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService;
import java.util.concurrent.Executors;

public class VirtualThreadExecutorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ExecutorService executor = Executors.newVirtualThreadPerTaskExecutor();

        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            int taskNumber = i;
            executor.submit(() -> {
                System.out.println("Task " + taskNumber + " running in: " + Thread.currentThread());
            });
        }

        executor.shutdown();
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **4. Improvements to `CompletableFuture`**

Java 23 enhances the **`CompletableFuture` API** to provide **better performance** and **simpler asynchronous programming**.

### âœ… **Key Improvements:**

- More **efficient task scheduling**.
- Enhanced support for **structured concurrency**.
- Better integration with **virtual threads**.

### ðŸ›  **Example: Using `CompletableFuture` with Virtual Threads**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

public class CompletableFutureExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompletableFuture<Void> future = CompletableFuture.runAsync(() -> {
            System.out.println("Running task in: " + Thread.currentThread());
        }, Thread.ofVirtual().factory());

        future.join();
    }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ **5. Improved `ExecutorService` Interface**

- **Semaphore**: Improved to handle **high concurrency scenarios**.

---

## ðŸ”§ **8. Scoped Values (Preview)**

Java 23 introduces **Scoped Values** (a preview feature), which are **thread-local variables** that can be shared across tasks within a **structured scope**.

### âœ… **Key Benefits:**
