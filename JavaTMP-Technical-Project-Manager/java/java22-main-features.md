# üìö **Java 22 Main Features and Enhancements**

Java 22 continues to evolve the Java platform by introducing **performance optimizations**, **new APIs**, and **tooling improvements**. Below are the key features and changes introduced in **Java 22**:

---

## üÜï **1. Enhanced Foreign Function & Memory API (3rd Preview)**

The **Foreign Function & Memory API** allows Java programs to interact with **native code** (e.g., C libraries) without using **JNI (Java Native Interface)**. This feature simplifies the process of calling native functions and working with memory outside the Java heap.

### Key Changes in Java 22:
- Improved performance and safety.
- Enhanced usability for interacting with native libraries.
- **Cleaner API** with better ergonomics for accessing native memory.

Example:

```java
import java.lang.foreign.*;

public class ForeignMemoryExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try (Arena arena = Arena.ofAuto()) {
            MemorySegment segment = arena.allocate(1024);
            segment.setAtIndex(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0, 42);
            System.out.println(segment.getAtIndex(ValueLayout.JAVA_INT, 0));
        }
    }
}
```

## üß© **2. Vector API (6th Incubator)**

The **Vector API** enables **SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)** operations, allowing Java programs to utilize **CPU-level parallelism** efficiently. It provides better **performance** for tasks such as **image processing, cryptography, and numerical computations**.

### Key Improvements in Java 22:
- More vector shapes and operations.
- Support for **ARM NEON** and **RISC-V vector instructions**.
- Enhanced performance on various hardware architectures.

Example:

```java
import jdk.incubator.vector.*;

public class VectorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FloatVector vector = FloatVector.fromArray(FloatVector.SPECIES_256, new float[]{1, 2, 3, 4}, 0);
        FloatVector result = vector.add(vector);
        System.out.println(result.toArray());
    }
}
```

## üîê **3. Scoped Values (2nd Preview)**

The **Scoped Values API** provides an alternative to **ThreadLocal** for sharing data across **threads**. It improves **readability, safety, and performance** by explicitly controlling the scope of shared values.

### Key Benefits:
- Safer than `ThreadLocal`.
- Ideal for passing **immutable values** between threads.
- Supports **structured concurrency**.

Example:

```java
import java.lang.invoke.*;

public class ScopedValuesExample {
    static final ScopedValue<String> USER = ScopedValue.newInstance();

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ScopedValue.where(USER, "Alice").run(() -> {
            System.out.println("Current User: " + USER.get());
        });
    }
}
```

## üñ• **4. Improved Windows Performance**

Java 22 includes **significant performance improvements** for **Windows environments**, focusing on:

- **Reduced startup time** for Java applications.
- **Improved native memory allocation** performance.
- **Better integration with Windows virtual memory management**.

---

## üåê **5. JDK HTTP Client Enhancements**

The **HTTP Client API**, introduced in Java 11, has been further enhanced in Java 22 with:

- **Improved handling of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 connections**.
- Better **asynchronous programming support**.
- **Performance optimizations** for large data transfers.

---

## üìÖ **6. Date-Time API Enhancements**

The **`java.time`** package in Java 22 introduces new methods and improvements to handle **date and time operations** more efficiently.

### Notable Changes:
- Support for **custom time units**.
- New methods to handle **period and duration calculations**.

Example:

```java
import java.time.*;

public class DateTimeExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LocalDate start = LocalDate.of(2023, 1, 1);
        LocalDate end = LocalDate.of(2025, 1, 1);
        Period period = Period.between(start, end);
        System.out.println("Years: " + period.getYears());
    }
}
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª **7. Improved Java Tools and JVM**

Java 22 includes various **JVM and tooling improvements** that enhance:

- **Garbage Collection (GC) performance**.
- **JVM startup and warm-up times**.
- **JIT compiler optimizations** for better runtime performance.
