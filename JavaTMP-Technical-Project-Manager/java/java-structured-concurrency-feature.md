# üöÄ **Java Structured Concurrency (Preview)** ‚Äì Introduced in **Java 21**

Structured Concurrency is a **major new concurrency model** introduced in **Java 21** as a **preview feature**. It aims to simplify **multithreaded programming** by managing **lifecycle and scope** of tasks in a **structured way**, making it easier to reason about concurrent code and avoid common pitfalls such as **resource leaks** and **orphaned threads**.

---

## üßê **What is Structured Concurrency?**

Structured Concurrency ensures that:

1. **Threads are started and stopped in a structured, predictable way.**
2. **Child tasks are bounded by the scope of their parent task.**
3. **No threads are left running accidentally beyond their intended lifecycle.**

Think of it as **structured blocks of code** (like loops or try-catch), but for **managing threads**.

---

### ü§î **Why Structured Concurrency?**

Traditional concurrency can result in:

- **Orphaned threads** (threads running beyond their intended lifecycle).
- **Difficult-to-manage task lifecycles**.
- **Resource leaks** due to threads not being properly shut down.

Structured Concurrency **avoids these issues** by ensuring that:

- Threads are **created, managed, and closed** within a **predictable scope**.
- Any **exception** in a task automatically **cancels related tasks**.

---

## üì¶ **New Classes in Structured Concurrency**

Structured Concurrency introduces the following key classes in **`java.util.concurrent`** package:

| **Class**                                  | **Description**                                          |
|--------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `StructuredTaskScope`                      | A base class to manage a **group of related tasks**.     |
| `StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure`    | Automatically shuts down all tasks on **first failure**. |
| `StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess`    | Automatically shuts down all tasks on **first success**. |
| `StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnCompletion` | Waits for **all tasks to complete**.                     |

---

### ‚úÖ **Structured Concurrency Scope Example**

Here‚Äôs a simple example of how **`StructuredTaskScope`** works:

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class StructuredConcurrencyExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
            Future<String> task1 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService1());
            Future<String> task2 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService2());

            // Wait for all tasks to complete or cancel them on failure
            scope.join();
            scope.throwIfFailed();

            // Get the results
            String result1 = task1.resultNow();
            String result2 = task2.resultNow();

            System.out.println("Results: " + result1 + ", " + result2);
        }
    }

    private static String fetchDataFromService1() {
        // Simulate fetching data
        return "Data from Service 1";
    }

    private static String fetchDataFromService2() {
        // Simulate fetching data
        return "Data from Service 2";
    }
}
```

---

### üìù **Explanation:**

1. **`StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure`**: Shuts down all tasks if **any task fails**.
2. **`fork()`**: Creates a **new task** and runs it asynchronously.
3. **`join()`**: Waits for **all tasks to complete**.
4. **`throwIfFailed()`**: Throws an **exception** if any task fails.

---

### üîß **Using `StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess`**

If you want to **cancel remaining tasks** after **one task completes successfully**, use **`ShutdownOnSuccess`**:

```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnSuccess<String>()) {
    Future<String> task1 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService1());
    Future<String> task2 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService2());

    scope.join(); // Wait for tasks to complete
    String result = scope.result(); // Get the first successful result

    System.out.println("First successful result: " + result);
}
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Error Handling in Structured Concurrency**

Structured Concurrency handles **exceptions** automatically. If a task **throws an exception**, the **scope will cancel all related tasks**.

```java
try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnFailure()) {
    Future<String> task1 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromService1());
    Future<String> task2 = scope.fork(() -> fetchDataFromServiceWithError());

    scope.join(); // Wait for tasks
    scope.throwIfFailed(); // Throws exception if any task fails
}
```

---

### üß™ **Advanced Example: Combining Results from Multiple Tasks**

```java
import java.util.concurrent.*;

public class AdvancedStructuredConcurrency {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException, ExecutionException {
        try (var scope = new StructuredTaskScope.ShutdownOnCompletion()) {
            Future<Integer> task1 = scope.fork(() -> computeValue1());
            Future<Integer> task2 = scope.fork(() -> computeValue2());

            scope.join(); // Wait for tasks to complete

            int result = task1.resultNow() + task2.resultNow();
            System.out.println("Combined Result: " + result);
        }
    }

    private static int computeValue1() {
        return 10;
    }

    private static int computeValue2() {
        return 20;
    }
}
```
