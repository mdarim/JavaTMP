main documents for system analyst

A **System Analyst** creates, reviews, and maintains a variety of documents to ensure
clear communication and successful system development. These documents serve as a
foundation for understanding system requirements, design, implementation, and maintenance.
Below are the **main documents** prepared or utilized by a System Analyst:

---

### **1. Requirements Documents**

These documents capture what the system should do and the expectations of stakeholders.

- **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**:
    - Describes the business needs and goals the system aims to achieve.
    - Includes high-level requirements without technical details.

- **Functional Requirements Document (FRD)**:
    - Details the specific functions the system must perform to meet the business needs.
    - Includes use cases, inputs, outputs, and process descriptions.

- **Non-Functional Requirements Document (NFR)**:
    - Captures system qualities such as performance, security, scalability, and usability.

---

### **2. Design and Architecture Documents**

These documents detail how the system will be built and its structural layout.

- **System Design Document (SDD)**:
    - Provides a detailed description of the system architecture, including diagrams and
      design patterns.

- **Database Design Document**:
    - Details the database schema, relationships, and queries.

- **Interface Design Document**:
    - Describes the design and functionality of the user interface (UI) and its
      interaction with the system.

- **Technical Specification Document**:
    - Offers detailed instructions for developers, covering system configurations, APIs,
      and technologies.

---

### **3. Modeling and Diagram Documents**

These visual representations help in understanding workflows, processes, and system
interactions.

- **Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**:
    - Illustrates how data flows through the system.

- **Use Case Diagram**:
    - Visualizes system interactions with actors (users or external systems).

- **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**:
    - Represents database relationships.

- **Unified Modeling Language (UML) Diagrams**:
    - Includes sequence diagrams, class diagrams, and activity diagrams to represent
      system structure and behavior.

---

### **4. Testing and Validation Documents**

These ensure the system meets its requirements and functions as intended.

- **Test Plan**:
    - Outlines testing strategies, objectives, and scope.

- **Test Cases and Scenarios**:
    - Lists specific scenarios to verify system functionality.

- **Traceability Matrix**:
    - Maps requirements to corresponding test cases to ensure all requirements are tested.

---

### **5. Project Management Documents**

These documents help manage timelines, resources, and communication.

- **Project Charter**:
    - Defines the project's scope, objectives, and stakeholders.

- **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**:
    - Breaks the project into smaller, manageable components.

- **Gantt Charts/Timelines**:
    - Visualizes project schedules and milestones.

---

### **6. Maintenance and Support Documents**

These documents guide the system's upkeep and troubleshooting.

- **System Manual**:
    - Provides technical details for administrators to manage the system.

- **User Guide**:
    - Explains how end-users can use the system effectively.

- **Troubleshooting Guide**:
    - Offers solutions to common issues users or administrators may encounter.

---

### **7. Reports and Analysis Documents**

These provide insights for decision-making and system evaluation.

- **Feasibility Study**:
    - Evaluates the technical, operational, and financial feasibility of the system.

- **Gap Analysis**:
    - Identifies differences between the current state and desired state of the system.

- **Risk Assessment Document**:
    - Identifies potential risks and mitigation strategies.

---

### **8. Change Management Documents**

These documents manage system updates and modifications.

- **Change Request Document**:
    - Captures requests for modifications to the system.

- **Impact Analysis Document**:
    - Assesses the potential effects of proposed changes.

- **Version Control and Release Notes**:
    - Tracks changes and updates in system versions.

---

### **Key Takeaways**:

- A System Analyst ensures all documents are well-organized, clear, and accessible to
  relevant stakeholders.
- These documents are essential for **communication**, **planning**, **design**, **
  testing**, and **maintenance**.
- Tools like Microsoft Office, Lucidchart, Visio, Jira, and Confluence often assist in
  creating and managing these documents effectively.
