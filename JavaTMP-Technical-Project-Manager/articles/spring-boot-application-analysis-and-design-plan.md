## **3. System Architecture**

### **3.1 Architecture Overview**
The system will follow a **microservices architecture** with a focus on modular design, enabling ease of deployment and scalability.

**Diagram:**
```
[Client] --> [API Gateway] --> [Microservices] --> [Database]
```

### **3.2 Core Components**
1. **API Gateway**
    - Used to manage and route requests to appropriate services.
2. **Authentication Service**
    - Manages user authentication and authorization using JWT.
3. **Business Logic Services**
    - Contains core functionalities and business rules.
4. **Database**
    - Uses relational/non-relational databases depending on the use case.

### **3.3 Technology Stack**
| Component          | Technology            |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| Framework          | Spring Boot 3         |
| Database           | PostgreSQL/MySQL      |
| Security           | Spring Security (JWT) |
| Frontend           | React/Angular         |
| Containerization   | Docker                |
| Orchestration      | Kubernetes            |
| Cloud Platform     | AWS/Azure/GCP         |

## **4. Data Design**

### **4.1 ER Diagram**
- Create an Entity-Relationship diagram that outlines the data model.

### **4.2 Database Tables**
| Table Name | Columns                | Data Type                | Constraints         |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|---------------------|
| Users      | id, username, password | Integer, String          | Primary Key, Unique |
| Products   | id, name, price        | Integer, String, Decimal | Primary Key         |

### **4.3 Data Flow Diagram (DFD)**
- Illustrate how data flows between components in the system.

---

## **5. Application Design**

### **5.1 Layered Architecture**
The application will be structured using a layered architecture:

1. **Controller Layer:** Handles incoming requests and responses.
2. **Service Layer:** Contains business logic.
3. **Repository Layer:** Interacts with the database.
4. **Entity Layer:** Defines the data model.

### **5.2 Class Diagram**
- Create a class diagram to illustrate the relationships between different classes.

### **5.3 Sequence Diagram**
- Show the flow of requests and responses between components.

---

## **6. Security Plan**

### **6.1 Authentication and Authorization**
- Use **Spring Security** with **JWT** to manage user authentication and role-based access control.

### **6.2 Data Protection**
- Encrypt sensitive data using **Jasypt** or **Bouncy Castle**.

### **6.3 CSRF Protection**
- Implement Cross-Site Request Forgery protection in the application.

---

## **7. Deployment Strategy**

### **7.1 Local Deployment**
- Use **Docker Compose** for local deployment.

### **7.2 CI/CD Pipeline**
- Implement a **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** pipeline for automated builds and deployments.

### **7.3 Cloud Deployment**
- Deploy the application on **AWS**, **Azure**, or **Google Cloud** using **Kubernetes** or **Elastic Beanstalk**.

---

## **8. Testing and Quality Assurance**

### **8.1 Unit Testing**
- Use **JUnit 5** and **Mockito** for unit tests.

### **8.2 Integration Testing**
- Use **Spring Boot Test** for integration tests.

### **8.3 Performance Testing**
- Use **JMeter** to ensure the application meets performance requirements.

---

## **9. Maintenance and Monitoring**

### **9.1 Monitoring Tools**
- Use **Prometheus** and **Grafana** for application monitoring.

### **9.2 Logging**
- Use **Logback** and **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging and analytics.

---

## **10. Conclusion**
This document provides a comprehensive analysis and design plan for building a Spring Boot application. It covers the key aspects of architecture, data design, security, and deployment, ensuring a scalable, maintainable, and secure application.
